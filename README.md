### Unreal Engine 5
Iâ€™m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 with C++; developing an action-RPG game. I am following the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Ultimate Game Developer Course by [Stephen Ulibarri](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephen-ulibarri-3/) on Udemy. It's really focused on C++ programming. Anything we do in blueprints, we then do with C++.

I made my graduation internship at an independent video game studio in New York City. I contributed to the development in Unity of a 2D combat platformer in a metroidvania style. I worked on various gameplay elements, including the implementation of new enemies, boss fights, dialogs and an inventory system. I also worked on some UI elements and internal tools.
